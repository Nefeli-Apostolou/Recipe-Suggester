Generate a simple browser app (no app store, runs in the browser) for suggesting recipes from ingredients.

## Requirements
1. **Technology**
   - Use plain HTML, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS.
   - No backend needed, everything runs in the browser.

2. **App Features**
   - Input box where user types ingredients (comma separated).
   - A button **"Find Recipes"**.
   - A hardcoded recipe list with these examples:

     ```js
    const recipes = [
  {
    title: "Pancakes",
    ingredients: ["flour", "milk", "eggs", "sugar"],
    categories: { taste: "sweet", diet: "vegetarian", gluten: "contains gluten", meal: "breakfast" }
  },
  {
    title: "Vegan Buddha Bowl",
    ingredients: ["quinoa", "chickpeas", "spinach", "avocado"],
    categories: { taste: "savory", diet: "vegan", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "lunch" }
  },
  {
    title: "Gluten-Free Brownies",
    ingredients: ["almond flour", "cocoa powder", "sugar", "eggs"],
    categories: { taste: "sweet", diet: "vegetarian", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "dessert" }
  },
  {
    title: "Lemon Chicken",
    ingredients: ["chicken", "lemon", "garlic", "olive oil"],
    categories: { taste: "sour", diet: "non-vegetarian", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "lunch" }
  },
  {
    title: "Vegan Lentil Soup",
    ingredients: ["lentils", "carrot", "celery", "tomato"],
    categories: { taste: "savory", diet: "vegan", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "dinner" }
  },
  {
    title: "Spaghetti Bolognese",
    ingredients: ["pasta", "tomato", "beef", "onion"],
    categories: { taste: "savory", diet: "non-vegetarian", gluten: "contains gluten", meal: "dinner" }
  },
  {
    title: "Greek Salad",
    ingredients: ["cucumber", "tomato", "feta cheese", "olive oil"],
    categories: { taste: "sour", diet: "vegetarian", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "lunch" }
  },
  {
    title: "Vegan Smoothie",
    ingredients: ["banana", "almond milk", "strawberry", "spinach"],
    categories: { taste: "sweet", diet: "vegan", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "breakfast" }
  },
  {
    title: "Gluten-Free Pizza",
    ingredients: ["gluten-free flour", "tomato sauce", "mozzarella", "basil"],
    categories: { taste: "savory", diet: "vegetarian", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "dinner" }
  },
  {
    title: "Grilled Fish",
    ingredients: ["fish", "lemon", "garlic", "herbs"],
    categories: { taste: "savory", diet: "non-vegetarian", gluten: "gluten-free", meal: "dinner" }
  }
    ];
     ```

   - When the user clicks the button:
     - Show only the recipes that include at least one of the entered ingredients.

   - Display recipes in **cards** with:
     - recipe title
     - list of ingredients
     - category tags (taste, diet, meal)

3. **UI**
   - Clean, minimal design with TailwindCSS.
   - Recipes shown in a responsive grid.
   - Category tags should be small colored badges.

4. **Stretch Features (optional if possible)**
   - Add a dropdown filter to filter by **meal type**.
   - Add a dropdown filter to filter by **diet** (vegetarian / non-vegetarian).
   - Add a search bar for recipe titles.

## Output
- Generate the code in a single file: `index.html`.
- Include all Tailwind setup via CDN (no build step).
- Ensure the file can be opened directly in the browser by double-clicking `index.html`.

# Generate a new Recipe Suggester HTML

Generate a **new HTML file** called `index_new.html` based on the current app. 
Include all existing functionality (filters, badges, ingredients) and add:

- Gradient background and colored sections
- Hover effects on recipe cards
- Ingredient amounts and instructions displayed
- Gradient title text
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Fully working filters (meal, diet, gluten, ingredients, search)

Do not overwrite `index.html`; output a **complete `index_new.html`**.

# Add Macronutrients to Recipe Suggester

Update the existing `index_new.html` file for the Recipe Suggester app. The file currently includes:

- Ingredient input, search, and filters (meal type, diet, gluten)
- Recipe cards with title, ingredients, amounts, instructions, and category badges
- Tailwind CSS styling with gradients, hover effects, and colored sections

Your task:

1. **Add Macronutrients:**
   - For each recipe, include **Protein, Carbs, and Fat** (in grams) next to the recipe’s other details.
   - Display macros in a small section under ingredients but above instructions.
   - Use a clear, visually distinct style (e.g., small badges or colored text using Tailwind CSS).

2. **Keep everything else intact:**
   - Filters must continue working
   - Badges, hover effects, and layout must not be broken
   - Ingredient amounts and instructions must remain

3. **Tailwind CSS styling:**
   - Make macro badges visually distinct, but cohesive with the existing color scheme
   - Keep modern, colorful, and clean design

4. **Output:**
   - Generate a **full updated `index_new.html`** including the new macronutrient info.
   - Do not create a new file name; keep it as `index_new.html`.

Do not add explanations—only output the complete HTML file.

# Update Recipe Ingredient Filtering

## Goal
Modify the ingredient filtering logic in `index_new.html` so that only recipes that **strictly match the entered ingredients** are displayed.  
Currently, recipes are shown if they contain *some* of the entered ingredients.  
We need to change it so that:
- All recipe ingredients must be included in the entered list.
- Recipes with extra required ingredients should not appear.

## Changes
In the JavaScript section of `index_new.html`, inside the `filterAndRenderRecipes()` function, replace this line:

```js
const ingredientMatch = enteredIngredients.length === 0 || 
    enteredIngredients.some(ing => recipe.ingredients.some(recipeIng => recipeIng.toLowerCase().includes(ing)));
```
with:
```js
const ingredientMatch = enteredIngredients.length === 0 || 
    recipe.ingredients.every(recipeIng => 
        enteredIngredients.some(ing => recipeIng.toLowerCase().includes(ing))
    );
```
# Update: Fetch Recipes from JSON

The application was updated to fetch the recipe data from an external `recipes_clean_1000.json` file. This replaces the hardcoded recipe array that was previously inside `index_new.html`.

This change involved:
-   Removing the `recipes` array from the script.
-   Using the `fetch()` API to load `recipes_clean_1000.json`.
-   Updating the JavaScript to handle the asynchronous loading of data.
-   Adapting the code to the new data structure provided by the JSON file.

This approach makes the recipe data easier to manage and update without modifying the application's core HTML and JavaScript code. To run the application locally, a web server is required to avoid browser security errors (CORS) when fetching the JSON file.

# Final Architecture: Docker and Flask Backend

The application was refactored to run in a Docker container using a Flask backend. This creates a stable, portable environment for the application and separates the frontend from the backend.

## Architecture Overview

-   **`index_new.html` (Frontend):** The user interface. It no longer fetches data from a local JSON file. Instead, it makes an API call to the Flask backend.
-   **`app.py` (Backend):** A simple Flask web server with two main roles:
    1.  It serves the static `index_new.html` file.
    2.  It provides an API endpoint at `/api/recipes` that reads the `recipes_clean_1000.json` file and sends the recipe data to the frontend.
-   **`recipes_clean_1000.json`:** The raw recipe data, now used by the backend.
-   **`Dockerfile`:** A set of instructions to build a Docker image containing the Python environment, dependencies (Flask), and the application code.
-   **`docker-compose.yml`:** A configuration file for Docker Compose that defines how to run the application container, including port mapping and volume mounts for live code updates.
-   **`requirements.txt`:** Specifies the Python dependencies (i.e., `Flask`).

## Running the Application

This setup ensures that the application runs in a consistent environment. To run the application:

1.  Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

To stop the application, run:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

# Update Recipe Ingredient Filtering

## Goal
Modify the ingredient filtering logic in `index_new.html` so that recipes are **hidden by default** and only appear when the user enters ingredients.  
Recipes should only appear if:  
- They contain **some or all and only** the ingredients typed by the user.  
- Ingredient names are **case-insensitive**.  
- Ingredient matches allow **partial words** (e.g., "water" matches "warm water").  
- The **order of ingredients does not matter**.  

## Changes
In the JavaScript section of `index_new.html`, inside the `filterAndRenderRecipes()` function, replace the ingredient filtering logic with:

```js
const ingredientMatch =
    enteredIngredients.length > 0 &&
    recipe.ingredients.length === enteredIngredients.length &&
    recipe.ingredients.every(recipeIng =>
        enteredIngredients.some(ing =>
            recipeIng.toLowerCase().includes(ing.toLowerCase())
        )
    );
```

**Goal**

Allow the app to suggest recipes even if the user is missing a few ingredients. This improves usability by showing “almost possible” recipes.

**Behavior**

Exact Matches (current behavior)

Recipes where every recipe ingredient is included in the entered list.

Displayed in a section called Exact Matches.

Almost Matches (new feature)

Recipes where all entered ingredients are present but up to 5 additional ingredients are required.

Recipes are sorted by the number of missing ingredients (ascending).

Displayed in a section called Almost Matches.

Ingredient Highlighting

In Almost Matches:

- Entered ingredients appear normal.

- Missing ingredients are wrapped in <span class="missing-ingredient">...</span>.

**Implementation Steps**

Update filterAndRenderRecipes() in index_new.html:

- Keep current filtering logic for Exact Matches.

- Add a second filtering pass for recipes with up to 5 missing ingredients.

Split results into two arrays:

- exactMatches

- almostMatches

Render both arrays in separate sections of the UI.

Apply CSS styling to missing ingredients.
